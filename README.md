# The Gaming Room

### Overview

This project was built for **The Gaming Room**, who wanted to move their Android game *Draw It or Lose It* to the web. The goal was to let players join from any device, manage multiple teams and players, and keep the system stable with only one active game service.

### Design

The game uses three layers:

* **Client:** what players see and use.
* **Application:** handles all game logic and communication.
* **Data:** stores players, teams, and game history.

This structure keeps the system organized and easy to update.

### Process

Planning the design before writing code made development smoother. Diagrams and documentation helped map out how data moved between layers and how users would interact with the game.

### What Went Well

The documentation stayed clear and aligned with the client’s needs. Starting with structure instead of code saved time and reduced errors.

### What I’d Change

I’d add more detail comparing cloud and local hosting to show how cost and scalability affect performance as the game grows.

### Approach

The design focused on modular code, simple maintenance, and scalability. I’d use the same process again—start with user needs, plan the structure, then code with flexibility in mind.
